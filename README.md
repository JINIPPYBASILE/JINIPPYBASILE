Hiya, it's <b>JINIPPYBASILE</b>! I try to make web projects, but most of the time I have no idea what I'm doing since I don't have a coding background. I enjoy and suffer trying to figure out how the Lorekeeper + Charadex framework operates, since they're pretty nifty. I also make miscellaneous side projects that I might need for my IAs, or because I hyperfixate on something and want to make something cool derived out of it.
